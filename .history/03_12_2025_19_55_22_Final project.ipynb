    "# Predicting Player Login Patterns: Forecasting Hourly Login Counts on a Minecraft Research Server\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For any online game server, it’s useful to know when players are most likely to log in. This helps with planning maintenance, managing server load, and understanding general player activity patterns. In many games, logins tend to follow clear time-of-day or day-of-week patterns, so it’s reasonable to ask whether we can predict player activity ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can we predict how many unique players will log into the server during a given hour?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this, we use an anonymized play session log from a Minecraft research server hosted by the University of British Columbia. Each row in the dataset represents one gameplay session, including when a player logged in and when they logged out. The session log file (`sessions.csv`) contains 1,535 rows and the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **hashedEmail** — anonymized player ID  \n",
    "- **start_time** — session start timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)  \n",
    "- **end_time** — session end timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)  \n",
    "- **original_start_time** — raw start timestamp before adjustment  \n",
    "- **original_end_time** — raw end timestamp before adjustment  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these timestamps, we transform the data into an hourly-level dataset. For each session start time, we extract several useful variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **date** — calendar date of the login  \n",
    "- **hour** — hour of day (0–23)  \n",
    "- **weekday** — day of week (Mon–Sun)  \n",
    "- **is_weekend** — TRUE/FALSE indicator for weekends  \n",
    "- **n_logins** — number of unique players starting a session during each hour (our target variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "This processed dataset is what we use for our exploratory analysis and for building a model to forecast hourly login counts.\n",
    "\n"
